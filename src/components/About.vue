          <p>
              I am currently a Third Year Student at Ryerson University, completing a Major in Computer Science.
              I am a motivated and curious person. I like to help and collaborate with my peers, in addition, to learn from them. I am passionate about Women in STEM, art, and design. I aspire to work in a tech company to tackle meaningful and challenging projects that will help our society today and moving forward in the future.
              Outside of school, I like to use my time to work on side projects and create artwork. As well, I like to attend hackathons and workshops related to technology to further expand my network and be able to grasp new ideas.
